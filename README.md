#Run mode
  As this notebook as built in Python, we can utilise all Python functionality. 
  Data Sources include : Local Files / Databases (library required) / Hadoop 
  
  Plotly has the ability to submit data to the Plotly server. Please be aware that submitting data to outside source may violate security constraints. Please be aware of all security criteria when submitting the data, and ideally refrain from doing so.
  
  It's possible to save the generated file locally, and this may help with the creation of a report.
  
  It's also possible to remove the graphing capability, and use some calculations to populate a mail which can allow the scheduling of this tool.


#Culture
  As this is openSource and freely available I would encourage everyone to add funtionality to this which can be merged back into the master and we can evolve this into a really useful tool.
